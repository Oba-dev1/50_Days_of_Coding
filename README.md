# 50_Days_of_Coding
🚀 Day 1 of the 50-Day Coding Challenge! 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 Yesterday marked the start of an exciting journey to level up my coding skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 💻✨

🌟 Day 1: Progress-Step Animation 🌟
(I dove right in and created a simple progress-step animation today. It might seem small, but it's a big deal for me! Learning something new every day is the name of the game.)

🌟 Day 2: Expanding Cards Animation🌟
(What's the deal, like wetin happen, wonky cards?
I was scratching my head, staring at the screen, wondering why my cards were getting all wonky. And then, it hit me like a ton of bricks - I had forgotten to add the closing div tags after copying the first image and h3 tags! 😅 Rookie mistake, right? But hey, we learn from our blunders!)

💡 Imposter Syndrome, I've got my eye on you! 👁️💪

I'll be honest, there are moments when the tech world feels like an endless galaxy of knowledge, but here's the secret: Every coder, no matter how experienced, once started as a beginner.

So, let's embrace the learning journey together! 🤝💡

I'm optimistic that with each passing day, these new concepts will start to make more sense. 🤓✨

Stay tuned for more coding adventures, challenges, and hopefully some 'aha!' moments. 🚀🤩

Feel free to drop a comment or a word of encouragement. Your support means the world to me on this quest to conquer code! 🌍❤️
